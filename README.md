# ðŸ§© GPT-2 AEON Internal Recurrence Attention Theory

## 1. Plant = GPT-2 Transformer with State Feedback

GPT-2 is normally **feed-forward** per step:

$$
h^{(l)}_t = \text{Block}^{(l)}(h^{(l-1)}_t)
$$

In AEON-Recurrence, each block has **internal state recurrence**:

$$
h^{(l)}_t = \text{Block}^{(l)}(h^{(l-1)}_t, r^{(l)}_{t-1})
$$

where $r^{(l)}_{t-1}$ is a **hidden recurrent state** feeding forward through time, not just tokens.

---

## 2. Internal Recurrence in Attention

Standard GPT-2 attention uses:

$$
\text{Attn}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
$$

AEON adds **internal recurrent attention memory**:

$$
K'_t = K_t + W_r r_{t-1}, \quad V'_t = V_t + U_r r_{t-1}
$$

so attention not only attends to the **current context**, but also to a **latent recurrent state** that encodes temporal dynamics across steps.

---

## 3. State Update Law

Each layer has a recurrence buffer $r_t^{(l)}$:

$$
r^{(l)}_{t+1} = G_r(r^{(l)}_t, h^{(l)}_t, \ell_t; \phi_r)
$$

* $G_r$: gated recurrence function (like GRU/LSTM-style DSP filter).
* Inputs: current state $r_t^{(l)}$, block activations $h^{(l)}_t$, and optionally scalar loss feedback $\ell_t$.
* $\phi_r$: recurrence coefficients, adapted online.

---

## 4. Scheduler Influence

Hyperparameters now adapt not only from global error trends, but also from recurrence:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_{t+1} &= f_\alpha(\Delta \ell_t, v_t, r_t) \\
\mu_{t+1} &= f_\mu(\Delta \ell_t, r_t) \\
\sigma_{t+1} &= f_\sigma(\text{success}_t, r_t)
\end{aligned}
$$

So **internal recurrence states** act as *feedback carriers* that shape LR, momentum, and exploration at the optimizer level.

---

## 5. Resonant-Recurrent Attention

Resonance (filtered error memory) combines with recurrence in attention:

$$
A_t = \text{softmax}\!\Big(\frac{Q_t (K'_t + m_t W_m)^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\Big)(V'_t + m_t U_m)
$$

* $m_t$: resonance memory (EMA of errors).
* This biases attention toward stable, recurring patterns that survived past adaptation.

---

## 6. Closed-Loop View

1. **Forward pass**: GPT-2 layers compute attention with recurrence inputs $r_t$ and resonance bias $m_t$.
2. **Measurement**: loss $\ell_t$ and variance computed.
3. **Scheduler**: hyperparameters $\alpha,\mu,\sigma$ adapted using error trends + recurrence states.
4. **Controller**: gradients filtered and scaled.
5. **Plant update**: $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - u_t + \sigma_t D(\theta_t)\eta_t + K_r r_t$.
6. **Recurrence update**: each layer updates its hidden recurrent state.

---

## 7. Interpretation

* **GPT-2 AEON Internal Recurrence Attention** is a **Transformer with built-in temporal memory loops** across layers and time.
* It augments **self-attention** with **internal recurrent attention** and **error-driven resonance memory**.
* Optimizer hyperparameters adapt **online** based on these signals.
* The whole system = **adaptive, recurrent, resonant control loop** embedded inside GPT-2.

---

## 8. Stability Notes

* Recurrence must be gated ($|A|<1$ or GRU-like) to avoid unbounded drift.
* Resonance decay $\rho$ ensures memory fades smoothly.
* Scheduler clips gains ($\alpha,\mu,\sigma$) to maintain stability.

# ðŸ”® Essence

**GPT-2 AEON Internal Recurrence Attention = GPT-2 + cybernetic recurrence + resonance.**

* **Attention** not only attends to tokens but also to **adaptive hidden recurrence states**.
* **Optimizer** adapts hyperparameters from both loss trends and internal recurrence.
* **Resonance** ensures stable long-term error memory.
* Result: a **continually adaptive Transformer**, self-tuned online.
